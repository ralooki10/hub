# Personal website

A place to shove in stuff about me and eventually projects I've been working on.

### Tech stack
My hub is a node app made with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) which I found out about at a JavaScript conference. It uses React for frontend amazingness and I'm looking forward to sprinkle in some swish interactions provided by [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### How to run
 
```
npm install
npm run dev -- -p 4000
```

And go to `localhost:4000` in your browser
